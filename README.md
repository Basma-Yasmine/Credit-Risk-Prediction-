# Credit-Risk-Prediction-
Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting loan default risk using a supervised machine learning classification approach. The goal is to analyze applicant data, handle missing values, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and train a model that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default.

Objective:
Predict whether a loan applicant will default or not
Handle missing and incomplete data
Explore relationships between key financial and demographic features
Train and evaluate a binary classification model

Dataset:
Name: Loan Prediction Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Type: Tabular (CSV)

Technologies & Libraries:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Project Workflow:
1️⃣ Data Cleaning
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3️⃣ Model Training
4️⃣ Model Evaluation

Skills Demonstrated:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Handling missing values
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Binary classification using machine learning
Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
